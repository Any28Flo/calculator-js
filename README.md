# Calculator with JS

***
## Introduction
One of the most common things we use is a calculator.

Let's create a calculator, where the users will be able to create some magic operations.

## Branches
You will find some branches
- main : You will find the code base of the proyect
- final : You will find the final code 
- react : You will find the code for react framework
- vuejs :  You will find the code for vuejs framework 
## Requeriments
- Fork this repo

## Submission
- Upon completion, run the following commands

```
    git add .
    git commit -m "done"
    git push origin main

```
- Create a pull request so your teachers can check up your work.

## Deliverables

Write your javascript code in `js/index.js`. When submitting, submit the whole repo.

### Iteration 1: 

Create the functions in `js/index.js` to calculate:
    - area of a square
    - area of a triangle
    - area of a circle 

Create the functions in `js/index.js ` to calculate:
    - perimeter of a square
    - perimeter of a triangle
    - perimeter of a circle

### Iteration 2: 
Test your functions

### Iteration 3:
Create forms or components to capturate data.
    - Form to square
    - Form to triangle
    - Form to circle
### Iterate 4: 
Integrate your js with your HTML

### Iterate 5:
Create functions in javascript to listen the events and lauch it the correct function an display the result.
